// - Tests that render the entire application with `renderApplication` go in the
//   top level `src/__tests__` directory and are named with `mytest.integration.test.tsx`.
//   These are ideal for when you need to test flows that include navigation between screens
// - Tests that render a single screen or component are colocated in
//   `__tests__/MyComponent.test.tsx`. These call `render` and are not able to
//   navigate between screens, since the Navigator is not mounted
