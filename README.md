# Belt

_While we actively use Belt internally at thoughtbot, this project is still in early phases of development, so its API might still change frequently._

Belt is an opionated CLI tool for starting a new React Native app. It makes the mundane decisions for you using tooling and conventions that we at thoughtbot have battle-tested and found to work well for the many successful apps we have built for clients.

Here are some of what gets configured when you start a new Belt app:

- Expo
- ESLint
- Prettier
- TypeScript
- Jest
- React Native Testing Library
- MSW for mocking
- React Navigation with bottom tabs
- Tanstack Query for REST APIs. Apollo Client for GraphQL coming soon!
- Redux Toolkit for global state (coming soon!)

## Usage

Create a new React Native Expo app using Belt with:

```sh
# With NPM
npx create-belt-app MyApp

# With Yarn
npx create-belt-app MyApp --yarn

# With pnpm (experimental)
npx create-belt-app MyApp --pnpm

# With Bun (experimental)
npx create-belt-app MyApp --bun
```

then run the command you'd like to perform:

```sh
# eg. add TypeScript to the project
yarn belt add notifications

# or, with NPM
npx belt add notifications

# or, with PNPM
pnpm belt add notifications
```
