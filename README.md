# Belt

Belt is a CLI tool for starting a new React Native Expo app and will keep your pants secure as you continue development.

Belts are not inherently innovative—they've been around even longer than pants—and neither is this tool! Belt creates your app using the absolute latest version of [create-expo](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/create-expo). It then layers on the missing pieces, based on the conventions we have found to consistently work for us at thoughtbot, so your pants will be secured tightly from the very beginning.

Here are some of what gets configured when you start a new Belt app:

- ESLint
- Prettier
- TypeScript
- Jest
- React Native Testing Library
- Custom test "render" function to facilitate testing
- MSW for mocking
- Directory structure
- React Navigation
- Tanstack Query (for REST APIs) or Apollo Client (for GraphQL) (coming soon!)
- Redux for global state (coming soon!)

## Usage

Create a new React Native Expo app using Belt with:

```sh
# With NPM
npx create-belt-app

# With Yarn
npx create-belt-app --yarn

# With pnpm (experimental)
npx create-belt-app --pnpm

# With Bun (experimental)
npx create-belt-app --bun
```

Or, if you already have an app and want to use Belt, run:

```sh
# with NPM
npm install --save-dev create-belt-app

# with Yarn
yarn add --dev create-belt-app

# with PNPM
pnpm install --save-dev create-belt-app
```

then run the command you'd like to perform:

```sh
# eg. add TypeScript to the project
yarn belt typescript

# or, with NPM
npx belt typescript

# or, with PNPM
pnpm belt typescript
```
